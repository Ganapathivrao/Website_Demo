But there&rsquo;s no need to upgrade to a new PC. Follow these&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3029168/microsoft-windows/windows-10-quick-tips-5-ways-to-speed-up-your-pc.html\">tips to speed up Windows 10</a>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Change your power settings</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you&rsquo;re using Windows 10&rsquo;s power-saver plan, you&rsquo;re slowing down your PC. That plan reduces your PC&rsquo;s performance in order to save energy. (Even desktop PCs typically have a power-saver plan.) Changing your power plan from power saver to high-performance or balanced will give you an instant performance boost.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To do it, launch Control Panel, then select Hardware and Sound &gt; Power Options. You&rsquo;ll typically see two options: balanced (recommended) and power saver. (Depending on your make and model, you might see other plans here as well, including some branded by the manufacturer.) To see the high-performance setting, click the down arrow next to Show Additional Plans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>[ To comment on this story, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Computerworld/posts/10155499795259680\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Computerworld&#39;s Facebook page</a>. ]</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To change your power setting, simply choose the one you want, then exit Control Panel. High-performance gives you the most oomph but uses the most power; balanced finds a median between power use and better performance; and power saver does everything it can to give you as much battery life as possible. Desktop users have no reason to choose power saver, and even laptop users should consider the balanced option when unplugged &mdash; and high-performance when connected to a power source.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"power settings\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/power-settings-100728256-large.jpg\" style=\"height:369px; width:700px\" />&nbsp;<small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Change your power settings in Control Panel to give your PC a performance boost.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Disable programs that run on startup</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">One reason your Windows 10 PC may feel sluggish is you&rsquo;ve got too many programs running in the background &mdash; programs that you may never use, or only rarely. Stop them from running, and your PC will run more smoothly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Start by launching the Task Manager: Press Ctrl-Shift-Esc or right-click the lower-right corner of your screen and select Task Manager. If the Task Manager launches as a compact app with no tabs, click &ldquo;More details&rdquo; at the bottom of your screen. The Task Manager will then appear in all of its full-tabbed glory. There&rsquo;s plenty you can do with it, but we&rsquo;re going to focus only on killing unnecessary programs that run at startup.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>[&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/321564/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fwindows-10-installing-configuring-implementing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Got a spare hour? Take this online course and learn how to install and configure Windows 10 with the options you need.</a>&nbsp;]</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Click the Startup tab. You&rsquo;ll see a list of the programs and services that launch when you start Windows. Included on the list is each program&rsquo;s name as well as its publisher, whether it&rsquo;s enabled to run on startup, and its &ldquo;Startup impact,&rdquo; which is how much it slows down Windows 10 when the system starts up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To stop a program or service from launching at startup, right-click it and select &ldquo;Disable.&rdquo; This doesn&rsquo;t disable the program entirely; it only prevents it from launching at startup &mdash; you can always run the application after launch. Also, if you later decide you want it to launch at startup, you can just return to this area of the Task Manager, right-click the application and select &ldquo;Enable.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"task manager\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/task-manager-100728255-medium.jpg\" style=\"height:267px; width:300px\" /><small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can use the Task Manager to help get information about programs that launch at startup and disable any you don&rsquo;t need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Many of the programs and services that run on startup, such as OneDrive or Evernote Clipper, may be familiar to you. But you may not recognize many of them. (Anyone who immediately knows what &ldquo;bzbui.exe&rdquo; is, please raise your hand. No fair Googling it first.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The Task Manager helps you get information about unfamiliar programs. Right-click an item and select Properties for more information about it, including its location on your hard disk, whether it has a digital signature, the version number, the file size and the last time it was modified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can also right-click the item and select &ldquo;Open file location.&rdquo; That opens File Explorer and takes it to the folder where the file is located, which may give you another clue about the program&rsquo;s purpose.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Finally, and most helpfully, you can select &ldquo;Search online&rdquo; after you right-click. Bing will then launch with links to sites with information about the program or service.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you&rsquo;re really nervous about one of the listed applications, you can go to a site run by Reason Software called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.shouldiblockit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Should I Block It?</a>&nbsp;and search for the file name. You&rsquo;ll usually find very solid information about the program or service.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Now that you&rsquo;ve selected all the programs that you want to disable at startup, the next time you restart your computer, the system will be a lot less concerned with unnecessary programs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Get help from the Performance Monitor</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There&rsquo;s a great tool in Windows 10 called the Performance Monitor that can, among other things, create a detailed performance report about your PC, detail any system and performance issues, and suggest fixes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To get the report, type perfmon /report into your search box and press Enter. (Make sure there&rsquo;s a space between &ldquo;perfmon&rdquo; and the slash mark.) The Resource and Performance Monitor launches and gathers information about your system. It will say that it will take 60 seconds, but I&rsquo;ve found that it takes several minutes. When the Monitor finishes, it will launch an interactive report.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"performance monitor\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/performance-monitor-100728249-large.jpg\" style=\"height:564px; width:700px\" />&nbsp;<small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can use the Task Manager to help get information about programs that launch at startup and disable any you don&rsquo;t need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Fix Windows 10 headaches</strong></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Microsoft Windows 10 has gone a long way toward fixing the problems that were endemic with earlier versions of Windows, notably Windows 8. But it&rsquo;s still far from a perfect operating system and has its share of headaches. Take the following advice for fixing three of its biggest headaches.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Fix Start menu woes</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">When it was first announced that Windows 10 would reinstate the Start menu, many users welcomed it. But after Windows 10 was released, some people began complaining about problems with the Start menu &mdash; it didn&rsquo;t run when they clicked the Start button, or it froze, or random entries appeared or disappeared. If you&rsquo;ve got Start menu problems, fear not; there are several ways to try to fix them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Note: Before trying any of these, first restart your computer. Sometimes a mere reboot will fix things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Run Microsoft&rsquo;s Start menu troubleshooter tool</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Before trying to fix any Start menu problems yourself,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12385/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-opening-start-menu-cortana\" rel=\"nofollow\">download Microsoft&rsquo;s Start menu troubleshooter</a>&nbsp;and run it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"troubleshoot start\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/troubleshoot-start-100728247-medium.jpg\" style=\"height:231px; width:300px\" /><small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The Start menu troubleshooter can help fix a variety of woes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The troubleshooter looks for Start menu problems and checks whether the problem is being caused by improperly installed applications, problems with the Registry, the database of Start menu tiles being corrupted, or difficulties with something called the application manifest. (The application manifest has settings that tell Windows how to handle a program when it starts.) After it checks for the problems, it does its best to fix them. If you want to see the results of what the troubleshooter finds, click &ldquo;View Detailed Information&rdquo; on the screen after the troubleshooter does its work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Note that the troubleshooter won&rsquo;t fix all problems. If it doesn&rsquo;t solve yours, you&rsquo;ll have to resort to other means.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Check for updates</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There&rsquo;s a chance that a Windows update will solve the problem &mdash; Microsoft continually squashes bugs in its updates. To make sure you&rsquo;ve got all the latest Windows updates, go to Settings &gt; Updates &amp; security &gt; Windows Update and click Check for updates. If it finds any, install them. You may need to restart your PC for the update to go into effect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Use PowerShell to fix corrupted files</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If the Start menu still has problems, the issue may be corrupted files. You can use a command-line tool called PowerShell that is built into Windows to find and fix them. Search for PowerShell in the Windows search box, right-click Windows PowerShell in the search results, and select &ldquo;Run as administrator.&rdquo; That will launch PowerShell.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If for some reason the search box isn&rsquo;t working, press the Windows key + R on your keyboard, type &ldquo;PowerShell&rdquo; and press Enter. That runs PowerShell, but not the administrator account, which you need to be using. That takes a few more steps: Right-click the PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select &ldquo;Pin to taskbar.&rdquo; Then close PowerShell. Now right-click the PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select &ldquo;Run as administrator.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Once you&rsquo;re running PowerShell as an administrator, type sfc /scannow and press Enter (note the space before the slash). PowerShell will scan your system for corrupt files. This can take some time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">When PowerShell finishes scanning your system, it will tell you that it found and fixed corrupt files, found corrupt files but couldn&rsquo;t fix them, or found no corrupt files. If it found corrupt files but couldn&rsquo;t fix them, type this command and press Enter: dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth. That should fix the problem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Recover lost storage space</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Windows 10 can be a hard-drive hog, especially if you&rsquo;ve upgraded to it from a previous version of Windows, or after a major Windows 10 update. That&rsquo;s because when you upgrade or install a major update, Windows 10 keeps the earlier version of the operating system, just in case you want to revert to it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">But that old operating system version is taking up several gigabytes of storage space. If you&rsquo;ve got a PC with plenty of storage, no worries. But if you&rsquo;re stretched for storage, it can be a serious problem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For example, I have an HP Stream laptop with 32GB of storage, and when I tried to upgrade to the newest version of Windows 10 I couldn&rsquo;t do it &mdash; my old Windows version took up so much space, the new version of Windows couldn&rsquo;t install.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re not going to want to revert to your old version of Windows, you can easily delete it. It&rsquo;s stored in a folder called Windows.old that you&rsquo;ll find in the /Windows folder. Rather than deleting it manually, though, use the Disk Cleanup tool:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the tool by typing Disk Cleanup in the search bar and clicking the Disk Cleanup search result that appears. The tool will take a few minutes to look through your system.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Disk Cleanup has finished, scroll down the list of files you can clean up and check the box next to Previous Windows installation(s). This entry will only appear if you&rsquo;ve got a previous Windows installation on your hard disk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK. The old version of Windows will be deleted, and you&rsquo;ll get your hard disk space back.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Enable Fast Startup</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">From the moment that Windows 10 was released, people started complaining that their bootup times were more sluggish than with previous versions of Windows. If you&rsquo;re plagued by a lethargic Windows 10 startup, there&rsquo;s a simple fix: use a feature called Fast Startup.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">With Fast Startup, when you shut down your PC, it closes your applications and logs off all users, but loads the Windows kernel and drivers to a hibernation file on your hard disk. Then, when you restart your PC, Windows loads the kernel and drivers from the hibernation file, speeding up startup.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Here&rsquo;s how to turn it on:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the Start button and select Power Options from the menu that appears.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click &ldquo;Additional power settings&rdquo; on the right side of the screen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click &ldquo;Choose what the Power buttons do.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the screen that appears, click &ldquo;Change Settings that are currently unavailable.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the screen that appears, check the box next to &ldquo;Turn on fast startup (recommended).&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click &ldquo;Save changes.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">That&rsquo;s all it takes. Note that on some machines Fast Startup isn&rsquo;t enabled. If that&rsquo;s the case with yours, you won&rsquo;t see the &ldquo;Turn on Fast Startup (recommended)&rdquo; entry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"fast startup\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/fast-startup-100728246-large.jpg\" style=\"height:394px; width:700px\" />&nbsp;<small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It&rsquo;s easy to turn up Fast Startup in order to speed up your bootup time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Protect your privacy</strong></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There has been some concern that Windows 10 gathers far too much private information from users. Whether you think Microsoft&rsquo;s operating system crosses the privacy line or just want to make sure you protect as much of your personal life as possible, we&rsquo;re here to help. Here&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3025709/microsoft-windows/windows-10-quick-tips-how-to-protect-your-privacy.html\">how to protect your privacy</a>&nbsp;in just a few minutes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Turn off ad tracking</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">At the top of many people&rsquo;s privacy concerns is what data is being gathered about them as they browse the web. That information creates a profile of a person&rsquo;s interests that is used by a variety of companies to target ads (resulting in the current popularity of ad blockers). Windows 10 does this with the use of an advertising ID. The ID doesn&rsquo;t just gather information about you when you browse the web, but also when you use Windows 10 apps.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can turn that advertising ID off if you want. Launch the Windows 10 Settings app (by clicking on the Start button at the lower-left corner of your screen) and go to Privacy &gt; General. There you&rsquo;ll see a list of choices under the title &ldquo;Change privacy options&rdquo;; the first controls the advertising ID. Move the slider from On to Off. You&rsquo;ll still get ads delivered to you, but they&rsquo;ll be generic ones rather than targeted ones, and your interests won&rsquo;t be tracked.</span></p>\r\n', '2020-03-15 23:54:34');

What if you can&#39;t seem to close an application, or can&#39;t hear any sound from your speakers? Whenever you have a problem with your computer,&nbsp;<strong>don&#39;t panic!</strong>&nbsp;There are many&nbsp;<strong>basic troubleshooting techniques</strong>you can use to fix issues like this. In this lesson, we&#39;ll show you some simple things to try when troubleshooting, as well as how to solve common problems you may encounter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">General tips to keep in mind</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There are many different things that could cause a problem with your computer. No matter what&#39;s causing the issue, troubleshooting will always be a process of&nbsp;<strong>trial and error</strong>&mdash;in some cases, you may need to use several different approaches before you can find a solution; other problems may be easy to fix. We recommend starting by using the following tips.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Write down your steps</strong>: Once you start troubleshooting, you may want to&nbsp;<strong>write down&nbsp;</strong>each step you take. This way, you&#39;ll be able to remember exactly what you&#39;ve done and can avoid repeating the same mistakes. If you end up asking other people for help, it will be much easier if they know exactly what you&#39;ve tried already.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Take notes about error messages</strong>: If your computer gives you an&nbsp;<strong>error message</strong>, be sure to write down as much information as possible. You may be able to use this information later to find out if other people are having the same error.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Always check the cables</strong>: If you&#39;re having trouble with a specific piece of computer&nbsp;<strong>hardware</strong>, such as your monitor or keyboard, an easy first step is to check all related cables to make sure they&#39;re properly connected.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Restart the computer</strong>: When all else fails,&nbsp;<strong>restarting the computer</strong>&nbsp;is a good thing to try. This can solve a lot of basic issues you may experience with your computer.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Using the process of elimination</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you&#39;re having an issue with your computer, you may be able to find out what&#39;s wrong using&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>process of elimination</strong>. This means you&#39;ll make a list of things that could be causing the problem and then test them out one by one to eliminate them. Once you&#39;ve identified the source of your computer issue, it will be easier to find a solution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Scenario:</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Let&#39;s say you&#39;re trying to print out invitations for a birthday party, but the printer won&#39;t print. You have some ideas about what could be causing this, so you go through them one by one to see if you can&nbsp;<strong>eliminate</strong>&nbsp;any possible causes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">First, you check the printer to see that it&#39;s turned on and plugged in to the&nbsp;<strong>surge protector</strong>. It is, so that&#39;s not the issue. Next, you check to make sure the printer&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>ink cartridge</strong>&nbsp;still has ink and that there is paper loaded in the&nbsp;<strong>paper tray</strong>. Things look good in both cases, so you know the issue has nothing to do with ink or paper.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Now you want to make sure the printer and computer are&nbsp;<strong>communicating correctly</strong>. If you recently downloaded an<strong>&nbsp;update to your operating system</strong>, it might interfere with the printer. But you know there haven&#39;t been any recent updates and the printer was working yesterday, so you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You check the printer&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>USB cord</strong>&nbsp;and find that it&#39;s not plugged in. You must have unplugged it accidentally when you plugged something else into the computer earlier. Once you plug in the USB cord, the printer starts working again. It looks like this printer issue is solved!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This is just one example of an issue you might encounter while using a computer. In the rest of this lesson, we&#39;ll talk about other common computer problems and some ways to solve them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Simple solutions to common problems</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Most of the time, problems can be fixed using simple troubleshooting techniques, like&nbsp;<strong>closing</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>reopening</strong>&nbsp;the program. It&#39;s important to try these simple solutions before resorting to more extreme measures. If the problem still isn&#39;t fixed, you can try other troubleshooting techniques.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: Power button will not start computer</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: If your computer&nbsp;<strong>does not start</strong>, begin by checking the power cord to confirm that it is plugged securely into the back of the computer case and the power outlet.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: If it is plugged into an outlet, make sure it is a&nbsp;<strong>working outlet</strong>. To check your outlet, you can plug in another&nbsp;<strong>electrical device</strong>, such as a lamp<strong>.</strong></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 3</strong>: If the computer is plugged in to a&nbsp;<strong>surge protector</strong>, verify that it is turned on. You may have to&nbsp;<strong>reset</strong>&nbsp;the surge protector by turning it off and then back on. You can also plug a lamp or other device into the surge protector to verify that it&#39;s working correctly.</span>\r\n	<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"resetting a surge protector\" longdesc=\"https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/basic-troubleshooting-techniques/1/\" src=\"https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073327dd48174331f516f_01_17_2014/desktop_reset_surge_protector.jpg\" /></span></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 4</strong>: If you are using a&nbsp;<strong>laptop</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>battery</strong>&nbsp;may not be charged. Plug the&nbsp;<strong>AC adapter</strong>&nbsp;into the wall, then try to turn on the laptop. If it still doesn&#39;t start up, you may need to wait a few minutes and try again.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: An application is running slowly</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Close and reopen the application.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Update the application. To do this, click the&nbsp;<strong>Help</strong>&nbsp;menu and look for an option to check for<strong>&nbsp;Updates</strong>.

If you are unable to force quit an application,&nbsp;<strong>restarting</strong>&nbsp;your computer will close all open apps.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: All programs on the computer run slowly</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Run a&nbsp;<strong>virus scanner</strong>. You may have&nbsp;<strong>malware</strong>&nbsp;running in the background that is slowing things down.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Your computer may be running out of hard drive space. Try&nbsp;<strong>deleting</strong>&nbsp;any files or programs you don&#39;t need.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 3</strong>: If you&#39;re using a&nbsp;<strong>PC</strong>, you can run&nbsp;<strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong>.

(71, 35, 'How do I take good care of my personal Laptop Computer?', 'It is important that you take good care of your laptop to keep it working well.', 'rajatt', '<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It is important that you take good care of your laptop to keep it working well. Following these easy steps will ensure that your laptop lasts longer and requires less maintenance. As an added bonus, many of the steps will also maintain your laptop&#39;s speed. It is also useful to do a check of the laptop once in a while so as to remove any errors or problems which might have crept in during the routine usage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Steps</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Keep liquids away from your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;As tempting as it might be to drink coffee, soda, water or any other liquid near your laptop, accidents can happen all too easily. Alternatively, use a cup with a cover on it, so even if it does spill, the liquid doesn&#39;t go anywhere. Spilled liquids may damage the internal microelectronic components or cause electrical damage. Short circuits can corrupt data or even permanently destroy some parts of the laptop. The solution is very simple: Keep your drinks away from your computer. Even if you are careful, someone else might spill your drink.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Having antivirus software available is the best defence against a virus</strong>.&nbsp;Even if you know what you download, it could still contain a virus. If you choose not to have antivirus software you run the risk of a circuit error or software problem in your system. The virus may also slow down the system operations and performance.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Keep food away from your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;Don&#39;t eat over your laptop, the crumbs can fall between the keys and provide an invitation to small bugs or damage the circuitry. Worse yet, the laptop will look dirty if there are crumbs on it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Do not use your computer in a room where animals are</strong>.&nbsp;Their fur and hair can get into the internal workings and damage them. Also larger animals (e.g dogs) can accidentally damage them by knocking them off their support by brushing past, wagging tail, tripping over leads etc.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Ideally keep the computer in a clean and dust free room.</strong></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Always have clean hands when using your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;Clean hands make it easier to use your laptop touchpad and there will be less risk of leaving dirt and other stains on the computer. In addition, if you clean your hands before you use the laptop, you will reduce wear and tear on the coating caused by contact with sweat and small particles that can act upon the laptop&#39;s exterior.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Protect the LCD display monitor</strong>.&nbsp;When you shut your laptop, make sure there are no small items, such as a pencil or small ear-phones, on the keyboard. These can damage the display screen if the laptop is shut on them; the screen will scratch if the item is rough. Close the lid gently and holding it in the middle. Closing the lid using only one side causes pressure on that hinge, and over time can cause it to bend and snap.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Hold and lift the computer by its base, not by its LCD display (the screen)</strong>.&nbsp;If you lift it by the screen alone, you could damage the display or the hinges attaching the display to the base. The display is also easily scratched or damaged by direct pressure &ndash; avoid placing pressure on it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t pull on the power cord</strong>.&nbsp;Tugging your power cord out from the power socket rather than pulling directly on the plug can cause the cord to break off from the plug or damage the power socket. Also, if the power cord is near your feet, avoid kicking it accidentally; in fact, it is best to refrain from bumping into the plug at all because you could loosen it and eventually break it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t roll your chair over the computer cord</strong>.&nbsp;Stick the cord onto your desk with tape or a special computer cord tie which can easily be undone when you&#39;ve finished using the laptop. Always try to keep the cord away from the floor and your legs.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Be sure to plug accessory devices into their proper slots</strong>.&nbsp;Always look at the symbols on the laptop carefully before inserting devices. Jamming a phone line into an Ethernet port or vice versa could damage the sockets, making it impossible to use them again. It is very important to observe this step.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Handle any removable drives with care</strong>.&nbsp;CD drives that have been removed from your laptop could easily be crushed or dropped; do not be careless. If you are not putting them back into the laptop, put them straight into a storage box or case for safekeeping.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Insert drives into their slots carefully and at the correct angle.</strong>&nbsp;Pushing the drive too forcefully into its slot could jam it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Check to see if labels are affixed securely before inserting media into your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;CDs, DVDs, or floppy disks should not have any loose labels that may jam inside the laptop. Never insert undersized CDs, as these can damage the disk player permanently.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t expose your laptop to rapid temperature changes</strong>.&nbsp;When bringing your laptop indoors during winter, don&#39;t turn it on immediately. Instead, let it warm to room temperature first. This will avoid any potential for damage to the disk drive from condensation forming inside the machine. Avoid heat from sunlight as well.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t leave your laptop in a car</strong>.&nbsp;Not only do the insides of cars experience large temperature swings that could damage a laptop, but a laptop (or laptop bag) is an inviting target for a smash and grab thief.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Have the unit cleaned annually to remove internal dust</strong>.&nbsp;Get this done by a computer professional, or do it yourself if you can. If dust accumulates, the system will not be able to cool itself correctly. Heat can destroy the motherboard.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Avoid placing heavy materials, such as books, on top of your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;This can push the LCD screen into the keyboard, and will eventually damage it. Also, the CD-ROM insert will be squished and, eventually, will break.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Use a properly-sized laptop case</strong>.&nbsp;Whatever you use to carry your laptop around, be it a case, a bag, or something you made yourself, make sure that it is large enough to hold the laptop. This will help avoid scratching, squeezing or potentially dropping it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Look into getting a laptop bag</strong>.&nbsp;Many breaks happen because laptops are dropped or bumped. A bag greatly reduces the risk of damage.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Only use and store your laptop in a well-ventilated area.</strong>&nbsp;When you are using your laptop, do so in a place that has a constant air-circulation. Lots of people ruin their laptops by using them in enclosed areas and thus cause the laptop to overheat.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Use an old toothbrush to clean the area around the exhaust fan screen</strong>.&nbsp;If that gets plugged up, air flow is diminished and overheating can occur.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Try to keep the laptop on a flat, clean surface.</strong>&nbsp;This prevents damage to the laptop. This can be hard to do, particularly if you are outside with your laptop, but if there is a flat surface available then put your laptop on it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t use your laptop on the bed.</strong>&nbsp;Repeated use of a laptop on the bed will cause the fans to suck up the dust and debris in the bed, ultimately blocking the fan.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Always check that your laptop does not have too much of software and bloat-wares running around as they keep eating the precious memory which is required for playing games or doing other high-end tasks.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Make sure that while downloading stuff from the web you do not download unwanted installers which are usually created to install unwanted softwares which are provided as freeware for providing the file which you require.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Also its preferable that you use a cleanup software like tune up utilities or c cleaner etc.</strong>&nbsp;for keeping your computer under constant surveillance from the unnecessary programs installed during various activities.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>If possible do a clean install of the operating system you use once every 2 to 3 years.</strong>&nbsp;This will really help the laptop to start from the scratch and maintain everything in a very organised and effective manner.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you are already on a device with low ram then do not trouble the device with programs which accelerate the processor, it is better if you switch over to another hard drive or pendrive to provide a bit of external ram and provides a bit of breathing space to the computers internals.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For providing external RAM in windows laptops there is an option called windows ready boost which gives an allocated space to be used as he virtual ram for the computer instead of being completely dependent on the internal memory provided.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Do not try to run large or unsupported multimedia files over your computer if your computer does not meet the specifications as it usually damages the computer in the long run.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It is also better if you head over to the local store and check for a complete maintenance check to solve any errors which keep troubling you.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Take care that if you use a laptop not to use it in places full of dust flying around as it may block the heat escape routes over a period of time and thereby make your laptop much hot faster than usual.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n', '2020-03-15 23:52:28'),

Jamming a phone line into an Ethernet port or vice versa could damage the sockets, making it impossible to use them again. It is very important to observe this step.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handle any removable drives with care&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;CD drives that have been removed from your laptop could easily be crushed or dropped; do not be careless. If you are not putting them back into the laptop, put them straight into a storage box or case for safekeeping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert drives into their slots carefully and at the correct angle.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pushing the drive too forcefully into its slot could jam it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check to see if labels are affixed securely before inserting media into your laptop&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;CDs, DVDs, or floppy disks should not have any loose labels that may jam inside the laptop. Never insert undersized CDs, as these can damage the disk player permanently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t expose your laptop to rapid temperature changes&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;When bringing your laptop indoors during winter, don&amp;#39;t turn it on immediately. Instead, let it warm to room temperature first. This will avoid any potential for damage to the disk drive from condensation forming inside the machine. Avoid heat from sunlight as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t leave your laptop in a car&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Not only do the insides of cars experience large temperature swings that could damage a laptop, but a laptop (or laptop bag) is an inviting target for a smash and grab thief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have the unit cleaned annually to remove internal dust&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Get this done by a computer professional, or do it yourself if you can. If dust accumulates, the system will not be able to cool itself correctly. Heat can destroy the motherboard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid placing heavy materials, such as books, on top of your laptop&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;This can push the LCD screen into the keyboard, and will eventually damage it. Also, the CD-ROM insert will be squished and, eventually, will break.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a properly-sized laptop case&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Whatever you use to carry your laptop around, be it a case, a bag, or something you made yourself, make sure that it is large enough to hold the laptop. This will help avoid scratching, squeezing or potentially dropping it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look into getting a laptop bag&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Many breaks happen because laptops are dropped or bumped. A bag greatly reduces the risk of damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only use and store your laptop in a well-ventilated area.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;When you are using your laptop, do so in a place that has a constant air-circulation. Lots of people ruin their laptops by using them in enclosed areas and thus cause the laptop to overheat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use an old toothbrush to clean the area around the exhaust fan screen&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;If that gets plugged up, air flow is diminished and overheating can occur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to keep the laptop on a flat, clean surface.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This prevents damage to the laptop. This can be hard to do, particularly if you are outside with your laptop, but if there is a flat surface available then put your laptop on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t use your laptop on the bed.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Repeated use of a laptop on the bed will cause the fans to suck up the dust and debris in the bed, ultimately blocking the fan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;Always check that your laptop does not have too much of software and bloat-wares running around as they keep eating the precious memory which is required for playing games or doing other high-end tasks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;Make sure that while downloading stuff from the web you do not download unwanted installers which are usually created to install unwanted softwares which are provided as freeware for providing the file which you require.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also its preferable that you use a cleanup software like tune up utilities or c cleaner etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for keeping your computer under constant surveillance from the unnecessary programs installed during various activities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If possible do a clean install of the operating system you use once every 2 to 3 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This will really help the laptop to start from the scratch and maintain everything in a very organised and effective manner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;If you are already on a device with low ram then do not trouble the device with programs which accelerate the processor, it is better if you switch over to another hard drive or pendrive to provide a bit of external ram and provides a bit of breathing space to the computers internals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;For providing external RAM in windows laptops there is an option called windows ready boost which gives an allocated space to be used as he virtual ram for the computer instead of being completely dependent on the internal memory provided.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;Do not try to run large or unsupported multimedia files over your computer if your computer does not meet the specifications as it usually damages the computer in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;It is also better if you head over to the local store and check for a complete maintenance check to solve any errors which keep troubling you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px&quot;&gt;Take care that if you use a laptop not to use it in places full of dust flying around as it may block the heat escape routes over a period of time and thereby make your laptop much hot faster than usual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2020-03-15 23:48:58'),

Follow these&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3029168/microsoft-windows/windows-10-quick-tips-5-ways-to-speed-up-your-pc.html\">tips to speed up Windows 10</a>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Change your power settings</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you&rsquo;re using Windows 10&rsquo;s power-saver plan, you&rsquo;re slowing down your PC. That plan reduces your PC&rsquo;s performance in order to save energy. (Even desktop PCs typically have a power-saver plan.) Changing your power plan from power saver to high-performance or balanced will give you an instant performance boost.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To do it, launch Control Panel, then select Hardware and Sound &gt; Power Options. You&rsquo;ll typically see two options: balanced (recommended) and power saver. (Depending on your make and model, you might see other plans here as well, including some branded by the manufacturer.) To see the high-performance setting, click the down arrow next to Show Additional Plans.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>[ To comment on this story, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Computerworld/posts/10155499795259680\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Computerworld&#39;s Facebook page</a>. ]</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To change your power setting, simply choose the one you want, then exit Control Panel. High-performance gives you the most oomph but uses the most power; balanced finds a median between power use and better performance; and power saver does everything it can to give you as much battery life as possible. Desktop users have no reason to choose power saver, and even laptop users should consider the balanced option when unplugged &mdash; and high-performance when connected to a power source.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"power settings\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/power-settings-100728256-large.jpg\" style=\"height:369px; width:700px\" />&nbsp;<small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Change your power settings in Control Panel to give your PC a performance boost.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Disable programs that run on startup</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">One reason your Windows 10 PC may feel sluggish is you&rsquo;ve got too many programs running in the background &mdash; programs that you may never use, or only rarely. Stop them from running, and your PC will run more smoothly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Start by launching the Task Manager: Press Ctrl-Shift-Esc or right-click the lower-right corner of your screen and select Task Manager. If the Task Manager launches as a compact app with no tabs, click &ldquo;More details&rdquo; at the bottom of your screen. The Task Manager will then appear in all of its full-tabbed glory. There&rsquo;s plenty you can do with it, but we&rsquo;re going to focus only on killing unnecessary programs that run at startup.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>[&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/321564/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fwindows-10-installing-configuring-implementing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Got a spare hour? Take this online course and learn how to install and configure Windows 10 with the options you need.</a>&nbsp;]</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Click the Startup tab. You&rsquo;ll see a list of the programs and services that launch when you start Windows. Included on the list is each program&rsquo;s name as well as its publisher, whether it&rsquo;s enabled to run on startup, and its &ldquo;Startup impact,&rdquo; which is how much it slows down Windows 10 when the system starts up.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To stop a program or service from launching at startup, right-click it and select &ldquo;Disable.&rdquo; This doesn&rsquo;t disable the program entirely; it only prevents it from launching at startup &mdash; you can always run the application after launch. Also, if you later decide you want it to launch at startup, you can just return to this area of the Task Manager, right-click the application and select &ldquo;Enable.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"task manager\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/task-manager-100728255-medium.jpg\" style=\"height:267px; width:300px\" /><small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can use the Task Manager to help get information about programs that launch at startup and disable any you don&rsquo;t need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Many of the programs and services that run on startup, such as OneDrive or Evernote Clipper, may be familiar to you. But you may not recognize many of them. (Anyone who immediately knows what &ldquo;bzbui.exe&rdquo; is, please raise your hand. No fair Googling it first.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The Task Manager helps you get information about unfamiliar programs. Right-click an item and select Properties for more information about it, including its location on your hard disk, whether it has a digital signature, the version number, the file size and the last time it was modified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can also right-click the item and select &ldquo;Open file location.&rdquo; That opens File Explorer and takes it to the folder where the file is located, which may give you another clue about the program&rsquo;s purpose.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Finally, and most helpfully, you can select &ldquo;Search online&rdquo; after you right-click. Bing will then launch with links to sites with information about the program or service.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you&rsquo;re really nervous about one of the listed applications, you can go to a site run by Reason Software called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.shouldiblockit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Should I Block It?</a>&nbsp;and search for the file name. You&rsquo;ll usually find very solid information about the program or service.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Now that you&rsquo;ve selected all the programs that you want to disable at startup, the next time you restart your computer, the system will be a lot less concerned with unnecessary programs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Get help from the Performance Monitor</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There&rsquo;s a great tool in Windows 10 called the Performance Monitor that can, among other things, create a detailed performance report about your PC, detail any system and performance issues, and suggest fixes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To get the report, type perfmon /report into your search box and press Enter. (Make sure there&rsquo;s a space between &ldquo;perfmon&rdquo; and the slash mark.) The Resource and Performance Monitor launches and gathers information about your system. It will say that it will take 60 seconds, but I&rsquo;ve found that it takes several minutes. When the Monitor finishes, it will launch an interactive report.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"performance monitor\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/performance-monitor-100728249-large.jpg\" style=\"height:564px; width:700px\" />&nbsp;<small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can use the Task Manager to help get information about programs that launch at startup and disable any you don&rsquo;t need.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Fix Windows 10 headaches</strong></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Microsoft Windows 10 has gone a long way toward fixing the problems that were endemic with earlier versions of Windows, notably Windows 8. But it&rsquo;s still far from a perfect operating system and has its share of headaches. Take the following advice for fixing three of its biggest headaches.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Fix Start menu woes</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">When it was first announced that Windows 10 would reinstate the Start menu, many users welcomed it. But after Windows 10 was released, some people began complaining about problems with the Start menu &mdash; it didn&rsquo;t run when they clicked the Start button, or it froze, or random entries appeared or disappeared. If you&rsquo;ve got Start menu problems, fear not; there are several ways to try to fix them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Note: Before trying any of these, first restart your computer. Sometimes a mere reboot will fix things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Run Microsoft&rsquo;s Start menu troubleshooter tool</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Before trying to fix any Start menu problems yourself,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12385/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-opening-start-menu-cortana\" rel=\"nofollow\">download Microsoft&rsquo;s Start menu troubleshooter</a>&nbsp;and run it.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"troubleshoot start\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/07/troubleshoot-start-100728247-medium.jpg\" style=\"height:231px; width:300px\" /><small>Preston Gralla/IDG</small></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The Start menu troubleshooter can help fix a variety of woes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The troubleshooter looks for Start menu problems and checks whether the problem is being caused by improperly installed applications, problems with the Registry, the database of Start menu tiles being corrupted, or difficulties with something called the application manifest. (The application manifest has settings that tell Windows how to handle a program when it starts.) After it checks for the problems, it does its best to fix them. If you want to see the results of what the troubleshooter finds, click &ldquo;View Detailed Information&rdquo; on the screen after the troubleshooter does its work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Note that the troubleshooter won&rsquo;t fix all problems. If it doesn&rsquo;t solve yours, you&rsquo;ll have to resort to other means.</span></p>\r\n', '2020-03-13 04:38:53');

No matter what&#39;s causing the issue, troubleshooting will always be a process of&nbsp;<strong>trial and error</strong>&mdash;in some cases, you may need to use several different approaches before you can find a solution; other problems may be easy to fix. We recommend starting by using the following tips.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Write down your steps</strong>: Once you start troubleshooting, you may want to&nbsp;<strong>write down&nbsp;</strong>each step you take. This way, you&#39;ll be able to remember exactly what you&#39;ve done and can avoid repeating the same mistakes. If you end up asking other people for help, it will be much easier if they know exactly what you&#39;ve tried already.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Take notes about error messages</strong>: If your computer gives you an&nbsp;<strong>error message</strong>, be sure to write down as much information as possible. You may be able to use this information later to find out if other people are having the same error.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Always check the cables</strong>: If you&#39;re having trouble with a specific piece of computer&nbsp;<strong>hardware</strong>, such as your monitor or keyboard, an easy first step is to check all related cables to make sure they&#39;re properly connected.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Restart the computer</strong>: When all else fails,&nbsp;<strong>restarting the computer</strong>&nbsp;is a good thing to try. This can solve a lot of basic issues you may experience with your computer.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Using the process of elimination</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you&#39;re having an issue with your computer, you may be able to find out what&#39;s wrong using&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>process of elimination</strong>. This means you&#39;ll make a list of things that could be causing the problem and then test them out one by one to eliminate them. Once you&#39;ve identified the source of your computer issue, it will be easier to find a solution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Scenario:</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Let&#39;s say you&#39;re trying to print out invitations for a birthday party, but the printer won&#39;t print. You have some ideas about what could be causing this, so you go through them one by one to see if you can&nbsp;<strong>eliminate</strong>&nbsp;any possible causes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">First, you check the printer to see that it&#39;s turned on and plugged in to the&nbsp;<strong>surge protector</strong>. It is, so that&#39;s not the issue. Next, you check to make sure the printer&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>ink cartridge</strong>&nbsp;still has ink and that there is paper loaded in the&nbsp;<strong>paper tray</strong>. Things look good in both cases, so you know the issue has nothing to do with ink or paper.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Now you want to make sure the printer and computer are&nbsp;<strong>communicating correctly</strong>. If you recently downloaded an<strong>&nbsp;update to your operating system</strong>, it might interfere with the printer. But you know there haven&#39;t been any recent updates and the printer was working yesterday, so you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You check the printer&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>USB cord</strong>&nbsp;and find that it&#39;s not plugged in. You must have unplugged it accidentally when you plugged something else into the computer earlier. Once you plug in the USB cord, the printer starts working again. It looks like this printer issue is solved!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This is just one example of an issue you might encounter while using a computer. In the rest of this lesson, we&#39;ll talk about other common computer problems and some ways to solve them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Simple solutions to common problems</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Most of the time, problems can be fixed using simple troubleshooting techniques, like&nbsp;<strong>closing</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>reopening</strong>&nbsp;the program. It&#39;s important to try these simple solutions before resorting to more extreme measures. If the problem still isn&#39;t fixed, you can try other troubleshooting techniques.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: Power button will not start computer</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: If your computer&nbsp;<strong>does not start</strong>, begin by checking the power cord to confirm that it is plugged securely into the back of the computer case and the power outlet.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: If it is plugged into an outlet, make sure it is a&nbsp;<strong>working outlet</strong>. To check your outlet, you can plug in another&nbsp;<strong>electrical device</strong>, such as a lamp<strong>.</strong></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 3</strong>: If the computer is plugged in to a&nbsp;<strong>surge protector</strong>, verify that it is turned on. You may have to&nbsp;<strong>reset</strong>&nbsp;the surge protector by turning it off and then back on. You can also plug a lamp or other device into the surge protector to verify that it&#39;s working correctly.</span>\r\n	<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"resetting a surge protector\" longdesc=\"https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/basic-troubleshooting-techniques/1/\" src=\"https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073327dd48174331f516f_01_17_2014/desktop_reset_surge_protector.jpg\" /></span></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 4</strong>: If you are using a&nbsp;<strong>laptop</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>battery</strong>&nbsp;may not be charged. Plug the&nbsp;<strong>AC adapter</strong>&nbsp;into the wall, then try to turn on the laptop. If it still doesn&#39;t start up, you may need to wait a few minutes and try again.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: An application is running slowly</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Close and reopen the application.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Update the application. To do this, click the&nbsp;<strong>Help</strong>&nbsp;menu and look for an option to check for<strong>&nbsp;Updates</strong>. If you don&#39;t find this option, another idea is to run an online search for application updates.</span>\r\n	<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"Checking for updates\" src=\"https://media.gcflearnfree.org/assets/content/computerbasics/15/troub_check_for_updates.jpg\" style=\"height:184px; width:424px\" /></span></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: An application is frozen</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Sometimes an application may become stuck, or&nbsp;<strong>frozen</strong>. When this happens, you won&#39;t be able to close the window or click any buttons within the application.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Force quit the application. On a PC, you can press (and hold)&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl+Alt+Delete</strong>&nbsp;(the Control, Alt, and Delete keys) on your keyboard to open the&nbsp;<strong>Task Manager</strong>. On a Mac, press and hold&nbsp;<strong>Command+Option+Esc</strong>. You can then select the unresponsive application and click&nbsp;<strong>End task</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>Force Quit</strong>&nbsp;on a Mac) to close it.</span>\r\n\r\n	<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"screenshot of Windows 8\" src=\"https://media.gcflearnfree.org/assets/content/computerbasics/15/trouble_task_manager.png\" style=\"height:379px; width:379px\" /></span></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Restart the computer. If you are unable to force quit an application,&nbsp;<strong>restarting</strong>&nbsp;your computer will close all open apps.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: All programs on the computer run slowly</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Run a&nbsp;<strong>virus scanner</strong>. You may have&nbsp;<strong>malware</strong>&nbsp;running in the background that is slowing things down.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Your computer may be running out of hard drive space. Try&nbsp;<strong>deleting</strong>&nbsp;any files or programs you don&#39;t need.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 3</strong>: If you&#39;re using a&nbsp;<strong>PC</strong>, you can run&nbsp;<strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong>. To learn more about&nbsp;<strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong>, check out our lesson on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gcflearnfree.org/computerbasics/protecting-your-computer/1/\">Protecting Your Computer</a>.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: The computer is frozen</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Sometimes your computer may become completely unresponsive, or&nbsp;<strong>frozen</strong>. When this happens, you won&#39;t be able to click anywhere on the screen, open or close applications, or access shut-down options.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1 (Windows only)</strong>: Restart Windows Explorer. To do this, press and hold&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl+Alt+Delete&nbsp;</strong>on your keyboard to open the&nbsp;<strong>Task Manager</strong>. Next, locate and select&nbsp;<strong>Windows Explorer</strong>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<strong>Processes</strong>&nbsp;tab and click&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>. You may need to click<strong>&nbsp;More Details</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom of the window to see the Processes tab.</span>\r\n\r\n	<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"screenshot of Windows 8\" src=\"https://media.gcflearnfree.org/assets/content/computerbasics/15/trouble_shutdown_restart.png\" style=\"height:600px; width:660px\" /></span></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2 (Mac only):&nbsp;</strong>Restart Finder. To do this, press and hold&nbsp;<strong><strong>Command+Option+Esc</strong>&nbsp;</strong>on your keyboard to open the&nbsp;<strong>Force Quit Applications</strong>&nbsp;dialog box. Next, locate and select&nbsp;<strong>Finder</strong>, then click&nbsp;<strong>Relaunch</strong>.</span>\r\n	<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"screenshot of OS X\" src=\"https://media.gcflearnfree.org/assets/content/computerbasics/15/trouble_relaunch.png\" style=\"height:289px; width:343px\" /></span></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 3</strong>: Press and hold the Power button. The Power button is usually located on the front or side of the computer, typically indicated by the&nbsp;<strong>power</strong>&nbsp;<strong>symbol</strong>. Press and hold the Power button for&nbsp;<strong>5 to 10 seconds</strong>&nbsp;to force the computer to shut down.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 4</strong>: If the computer still won&#39;t shut down, you can&nbsp;<strong>unplug the power cable</strong>&nbsp;from the electrical outlet. If you&#39;re using a laptop, you may be able to remove the battery to force the computer to turn off.&nbsp;<strong>Note</strong>: This solution should be your&nbsp;<strong>last resort</strong>&nbsp;after trying the other suggestions above.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: The mouse or keyboard has stopped working</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: If you&#39;re using a&nbsp;<strong>wired</strong>&nbsp;mouse or keyboard, make sure it&#39;s correctly plugged into the computer.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: If you&#39;re using a&nbsp;<strong>wireless</strong>&nbsp;mouse or keyboard, make sure it&#39;s turned on and that its batteries are charged.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: The sound isn&#39;t working</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: Check the volume level. Click the audio button in the top-right or bottom-right corner of the screen to make sure the sound is turned on and that the volume is up.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 2</strong>: Check the audio player controls. Many audio and video players will have their own separate audio controls. Make sure the sound is turned on and that the volume is turned up in the player.</span>\r\n	<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"screenshot of iTunes\" src=\"https://media.gcflearnfree.org/assets/content/computerbasics/15/trouble_sound_itunes.jpg\" style=\"height:68px; width:635px\" /></span></p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 3</strong>: Check the cables. Make sure external speakers are plugged in, turned on, and connected to the correct audio port or a USB port. If your computer has&nbsp;<strong>color-coded</strong>&nbsp;ports, the audio output port will usually be&nbsp;<strong>green</strong>.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 4</strong>: Connect headphones to the computer to find out if you can hear sound through the headphones.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Problem: The screen is blank</span></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Solution 1</strong>: The computer may be in&nbsp;<strong>Sleep</strong>&nbsp;mode.

As an easy starting point, we&#39;d recommend&nbsp;<strong>searching the Web</strong>. It&#39;s possible that other users have had similar problems, and solutions to these problems are often posted online. Also, if you have a friend or family member who knows a lot about computers, they may be able to help you.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><img alt=\"google screenshot\" src=\"https://media.gcflearnfree.org/assets/content/computerbasics/15/comp_L15P5_google2.png\" style=\"height:113px; width:605px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Keep in mind that most computer problems have simple solutions, although it may take some time to find them. For difficult problems, a&nbsp;<strong>more drastic solution</strong>&nbsp;may be required, like reformatting your hard drive or reinstalling your operating system. If you think you might need a solution like this, we recommend&nbsp;<strong>consulting a professional</strong>first. If you&#39;re not a computer expert, it&#39;s possible that attempting these solutions could make the situation worse.</span></p>\r\n', '2020-03-13 04:45:34'),
(58, NULL, 'How do I take good care of my personal Laptop Computer?', 'It is important that you take good care of your laptop to keep it working well.', 'gana', '<h2><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Steps</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Keep liquids away from your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;As tempting as it might be to drink coffee, soda, water or any other liquid near your laptop, accidents can happen all too easily. Alternatively, use a cup with a cover on it, so even if it does spill, the liquid doesn&#39;t go anywhere. Spilled liquids may damage the internal microelectronic components or cause electrical damage. Short circuits can corrupt data or even permanently destroy some parts of the laptop. The solution is very simple: Keep your drinks away from your computer. Even if you are careful, someone else might spill your drink.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Having antivirus software available is the best defence against a virus</strong>.&nbsp;Even if you know what you download, it could still contain a virus. If you choose not to have antivirus software you run the risk of a circuit error or software problem in your system. The virus may also slow down the system operations and performance.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Keep food away from your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;Don&#39;t eat over your laptop, the crumbs can fall between the keys and provide an invitation to small bugs or damage the circuitry. Worse yet, the laptop will look dirty if there are crumbs on it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Do not use your computer in a room where animals are</strong>.&nbsp;Their fur and hair can get into the internal workings and damage them. Also larger animals (e.g dogs) can accidentally damage them by knocking them off their support by brushing past, wagging tail, tripping over leads etc.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Ideally keep the computer in a clean and dust free room.</strong></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Always have clean hands when using your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;Clean hands make it easier to use your laptop touchpad and there will be less risk of leaving dirt and other stains on the computer. In addition, if you clean your hands before you use the laptop, you will reduce wear and tear on the coating caused by contact with sweat and small particles that can act upon the laptop&#39;s exterior.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Protect the LCD display monitor</strong>.&nbsp;When you shut your laptop, make sure there are no small items, such as a pencil or small ear-phones, on the keyboard. These can damage the display screen if the laptop is shut on them; the screen will scratch if the item is rough. Close the lid gently and holding it in the middle. Closing the lid using only one side causes pressure on that hinge, and over time can cause it to bend and snap.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Hold and lift the computer by its base, not by its LCD display (the screen)</strong>.&nbsp;If you lift it by the screen alone, you could damage the display or the hinges attaching the display to the base. The display is also easily scratched or damaged by direct pressure &ndash; avoid placing pressure on it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t pull on the power cord</strong>.&nbsp;Tugging your power cord out from the power socket rather than pulling directly on the plug can cause the cord to break off from the plug or damage the power socket. Also, if the power cord is near your feet, avoid kicking it accidentally; in fact, it is best to refrain from bumping into the plug at all because you could loosen it and eventually break it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t roll your chair over the computer cord</strong>.&nbsp;Stick the cord onto your desk with tape or a special computer cord tie which can easily be undone when you&#39;ve finished using the laptop. Always try to keep the cord away from the floor and your legs.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Be sure to plug accessory devices into their proper slots</strong>.&nbsp;Always look at the symbols on the laptop carefully before inserting devices. Jamming a phone line into an Ethernet port or vice versa could damage the sockets, making it impossible to use them again. It is very important to observe this step.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Handle any removable drives with care</strong>.&nbsp;CD drives that have been removed from your laptop could easily be crushed or dropped; do not be careless. If you are not putting them back into the laptop, put them straight into a storage box or case for safekeeping.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Insert drives into their slots carefully and at the correct angle.</strong>&nbsp;Pushing the drive too forcefully into its slot could jam it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Check to see if labels are affixed securely before inserting media into your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;CDs, DVDs, or floppy disks should not have any loose labels that may jam inside the laptop. Never insert undersized CDs, as these can damage the disk player permanently.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t expose your laptop to rapid temperature changes</strong>.&nbsp;When bringing your laptop indoors during winter, don&#39;t turn it on immediately. Instead, let it warm to room temperature first. This will avoid any potential for damage to the disk drive from condensation forming inside the machine. Avoid heat from sunlight as well.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t leave your laptop in a car</strong>.&nbsp;Not only do the insides of cars experience large temperature swings that could damage a laptop, but a laptop (or laptop bag) is an inviting target for a smash and grab thief.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Have the unit cleaned annually to remove internal dust</strong>.&nbsp;Get this done by a computer professional, or do it yourself if you can. If dust accumulates, the system will not be able to cool itself correctly. Heat can destroy the motherboard.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Avoid placing heavy materials, such as books, on top of your laptop</strong>.&nbsp;This can push the LCD screen into the keyboard, and will eventually damage it. Also, the CD-ROM insert will be squished and, eventually, will break.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Use a properly-sized laptop case</strong>.&nbsp;Whatever you use to carry your laptop around, be it a case, a bag, or something you made yourself, make sure that it is large enough to hold the laptop. This will help avoid scratching, squeezing or potentially dropping it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Look into getting a laptop bag</strong>.&nbsp;Many breaks happen because laptops are dropped or bumped. A bag greatly reduces the risk of damage.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Only use and store your laptop in a well-ventilated area.</strong>&nbsp;When you are using your laptop, do so in a place that has a constant air-circulation. Lots of people ruin their laptops by using them in enclosed areas and thus cause the laptop to overheat.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Use an old toothbrush to clean the area around the exhaust fan screen</strong>.&nbsp;If that gets plugged up, air flow is diminished and overheating can occur.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Try to keep the laptop on a flat, clean surface.</strong>&nbsp;This prevents damage to the laptop. This can be hard to do, particularly if you are outside with your laptop, but if there is a flat surface available then put your laptop on it.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Don&#39;t use your laptop on the bed.</strong>&nbsp;Repeated use of a laptop on the bed will cause the fans to suck up the dust and debris in the bed, ultimately blocking the fan.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Always check that your laptop does not have too much of software and bloat-wares running around as they keep eating the precious memory which is required for playing games or doing other high-end tasks.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Make sure that while downloading stuff from the web you do not download unwanted installers which are usually created to install unwanted softwares which are provided as freeware for providing the file which you require.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Also its preferable that you use a cleanup software like tune up utilities or c cleaner etc.</strong>&nbsp;for keeping your computer under constant surveillance from the unnecessary programs installed during various activities.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>If possible do a clean install of the operating system you use once every 2 to 3 years.</strong>&nbsp;This will really help the laptop to start from the scratch and maintain everything in a very organised and effective manner.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you are already on a device with low ram then do not trouble the device with programs which accelerate the processor, it is better if you switch over to another hard drive or pendrive to provide a bit of external ram and provides a bit of breathing space to the computers internals.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For providing external RAM in windows laptops there is an option called windows ready boost which gives an allocated space to be used as he virtual ram for the computer instead of being completely dependent on the internal memory provided.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Do not try to run large or unsupported multimedia files over your computer if your computer does not meet the specifications as it usually damages the computer in the long run.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It is also better if you head over to the local store and check for a complete maintenance check to solve any errors which keep troubling you.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Take care that if you use a laptop not to use it in places full of dust flying around as it may block the heat escape routes over a period of time and thereby make your laptop much hot faster than usual.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', '2020-03-13 04:48:41'),
(59, NULL, 'HOW DOES A COMPUTER WORK?', 'A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components', 'gana', '<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and after it processes the data, it sends it back through an output device. How does this come together to make the computer work?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The input devices of a computer can depend on the type of computer we are dealing with but most typically we will find a mouse, keyboard, scanner or even applications (software) installed on the computer. Once the data has been received, the central processing unit (CPU) along with the help of other components, takes over and processes the information it was given. Once the data is ready, it will be sent back through an output device which can be a monitor, speaker, printer, ports, etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To better imagine how a computer works, knowing what&rsquo;s inside will make it easier. Here are the main components of a computer:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>CPU</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; or Central Processing Unit is considered the most important component in a computer and for good reason. It handles most operations that make it function, by processing instructions and giving signals out to other components. The CPU is the main bridge between all the computer&rsquo;s major parts.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>RAM&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Random Access Memory, or RAM for short, is a computer component where data used by the operating system and software applications store data so that the CPU can process them quickly. Everything stored on RAM is lost if the computer is shut off. Depending on the applications you use, there is typically a maximum limit of RAM you will need for the computer to function properly.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>HDD&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Also known as Hard Disk Drive, it is the component where photos, apps, documents and such are kept. Although they are still being used, we have much faster types of storage devices such as solid state drives (SSD) that are also more reliable.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Motherboard&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; There is no acronym for this component but without it, there can&rsquo;t be a computer. The Motherboard acts as the home for all other components, allows them to communicate with each other and gives them power in order to function. There are components that don&rsquo;t require a physical connection to the Motherboard in order to work, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi but, if there is no connection or signal what so ever, the computer won&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s there.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Video and Sound Cards&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Two components which help the user interact with the computer. Although one can use a computer with a missing sound card, it&rsquo;s not really possible to use it without a video card. The sound card is used mainly to play sound through a speaker. However, a video card is used to send images on the screen. Without it, it would be like looking at an empty monitor.</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Network adapter&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Even though it is not actually required to operate the computer, the Network adapter improves the user&rsquo;s experience as it provides access to the internet. Modern computers with operating systems such as Windows 10 will not offer the user all of its features without an Internet connection.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If you are having trouble with any of your computer&rsquo;s internal or external components, please do not hesitate to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.geeksonsite.com/contact-us/\">contact Geeks on Site</a>.
